# Software Requirement Specifications of Advanced Driver Assistance System 
## Introduction
### Purpose
#### The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). It will explain the purpose and features of the system, interfaces, and what the system will do considering some constraints with how the system will react to them.            
### Intended Audience
#### Daily drivers are the main portion of the audience although it seems to serve a much greater sector of the impaired/handicapped. 

           
### Product Scope
#### This software will be an ADAS Combined with a line follower car. This system will be designed to maximize the Driver experience as well as passengers by providing better cruise control and Safety features which would otherwise have to be performed manually. Using this system will result in maximizing Driver/Passengers Safety and should meet User needs while remains easy to use.
#### The ADAS system has 1 active actor (Driver) and 4 use cases half are on periodic use and the other half are being chosen by user indication. ![image](https://github.com/EL-Gohary1/ADAS-using-Tiva-C-Series-TM4C123GH6PM/assets/135604535/cbaeb194-cac4-4786-8ae3-be938ad00420)

### Assumptions and Dependencies
#### The main Purpose of the whole project is to provide realistic concept of assistance for drivers within day-to-day operations for drivers assuming some hardware comprises and tolerated in accuracy within specific threshold.
